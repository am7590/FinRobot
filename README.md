**FinRobot** is an AI Agent Platform that transcends the scope of FinGPT, representing a comprehensive solution meticulously designed for financial applications. It integrates **a diverse array of AI technologies**, extending beyond mere language models. This expansive vision highlights the platform's versatility and adaptability, addressing the multifaceted needs of the financial industry.

**Concept of AI Agent**: an AI Agent is an intelligent entity that uses large language models as its brain to perceive its environment, make decisions, and execute actions. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence, AI Agents possess the ability to independently think and utilize tools to progressively achieve given objectives.
