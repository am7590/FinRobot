Resource: Financial metrics for DIS and ['NFLX', 'CMCSA', 'ATVI'].

Instruction: 
Analyze the financial metrics for {company}/ticker_symbol and its competitors: {competitors} across multiple years (indicated as 0, 1, 2, 3, with 0 being the latest year and 3 the earliest year). Focus on the following metrics: EBITDA Margin, EV/EBITDA, FCF Conversion, Gross Margin, ROIC, Revenue, and Revenue Growth. 
For each year: Year-over-Year Trends: Identify and discuss the trends for each metric from the earliest year (3) to the latest year (0) for {company}. But when generating analysis, you need to write 1: year 3 = year 2023, 2: year 2 = year 2022, 3: year 1 = year 2021 and 4: year 0 = year 2020. Highlight any significant improvements, declines, or stability in these metrics over time.
Competitor Comparison: For each year, compare {company} against its {competitors} for each metric. Evaluate how {company} performs relative to its {competitors}, noting where it outperforms or lags behind.
Metric-Specific Insights:

EBITDA Margin: Discuss the profitability of {company} compared to its {competitors}, particularly in the most recent year.
EV/EBITDA: Provide insights on the valuation and whether {company} is over or undervalued compared to its {competitors} in each year.
FCF Conversion: Evaluate the cash flow efficiency of {company} relative to its {competitors} over time.
Gross Margin: Analyze the cost efficiency and profitability in each year.
ROIC: Discuss the return on invested capital and what it suggests about the company's efficiency in generating returns from its investments, especially focusing on recent trends.
Revenue and Revenue Growth: Provide a comprehensive view of {company}'s revenue performance and growth trajectory, noting any significant changes or patterns.
Conclusion: Summarize the overall financial health of {company} based on these metrics. Discuss how {company}'s performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).
Avoid using any bullet points.
