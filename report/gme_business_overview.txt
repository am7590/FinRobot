 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

GameStop Corp. (&#8220;GameStop,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) offers games and entertainment products through its stores and ecommerce platforms. 

Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2022 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2023 ("fiscal 2022"). Fiscal year 2021 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 29, 2022 ("fiscal 2021") and fiscal year 2020 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2021 ("fiscal 2020"). 

Reportable Segments 

We operate in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified segments based on a combination of geographic areas, which is the basis of how we manage the organization and analyze performance. Our Australia geographic segment includes operations in New Zealand for reporting. Our sales and profits are driven through both our physical stores and ecommerce platforms. Each segment consists primarily of retail operations, with the significant majority focused on games, entertainment products and technology. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products in the various segments. 

As of January 28, 2023, we had a total of 4,413 stores across all of our segments; 2,949 in the United States, 216 in Canada, 419 in Australia and 829 in Europe. Our stores and ecommerce sites operate primarily under the names GameStop &#174; , EB Games &#174; and Micromania &#174; . 

Our Australia and Europe segments also include 52 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture &#174; brand. Our brands also include our print and digital gaming publication, Game Informer &#174; magazine. 

Financial information about our segments is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5 , "Segment Information," of this Form 10-K. 

Merchandise 

We categorize our sale of products as follows: 

&#8226; Hardware and accessories. We offer new and pre-owned gaming platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Nintendo Switch. Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, and virtual reality products. 

&#8226; Software. We offer new and pre-owned gaming software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content and full-game downloads. 

&#8226; Collectibles. Collectibles consist of apparel, toys, trading cards, gadgets, and other retail products for pop culture and technology enthusiasts, and our digital asset wallet and NFT marketplace activities. 

Trade-In Program 

We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned gaming, mobility, and other products at our stores in exchange for cash or credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. This process drives higher market share and offers a broader range of price points for our customers. Our trade-in program provides customers a means to unlock value and recycle used product, which enables us to offer previous generation platforms and related games. We operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where used gaming, mobility and other products can be tested, repaired, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for sale. 

Sustainability 

We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take gaming consoles, gaming software and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2022 alone, through our United States refurbishment center, we refurbished over 0.9 million pieces of software discs and over 2.8 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 0.7 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease in the United States over our baseline year of 2009. In 2022, we achieved a reduction in year over year carbon emissions in excess of 10% in the United States through both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. 

Store Locations 

Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 28, 2023, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,413 stores worldwide as more specifically set forth below: 

Domestic Locations. The table below sets forth the number and locations of our domestic stores included in the United States segment.

Business Strategy 

GameStop is on a strategic path to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability in the near term, while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries. 

GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives: 

&#8226; Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes app &#38; site redesigns, better product availability across all channels, improved fulfillment speed, partnerships and store concepts to attract new customers, and a further improved customer service experience. 

&#8226; Achieve Profitability. During fiscal 2022, we optimized our corporate cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs following the completion of a majority of the necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we streamline parts of the organization where we can operate with increased efficiency. 

&#8226; Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth. GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers. We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth. 

We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. 

PowerUp Rewards 

Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards &#174; ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 56.7 million members as of January 28, 2023, of which approximately 15.0 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop &#174; in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 5.6 million paying pro members. Our loyalty program generally offers our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership, the latter of which gives our customers access to exclusive gaming related rewards. The program's paid membership generally include a subscription to Game Informer &#174; magazine and additional discounts and benefits in our stores and ecommerce platforms. 

Game Informer &#174; 

We publish Game Informer &#174; , a leading gaming publication featuring reviews of new releases, previews of the big titles on the horizon, and coverage of the latest developments in the gaming industry. The magazine is available by subscription, in both digital and physical formats and is sold both online and in-store. Game Informer &#174; is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards Pro membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer &#174; are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer &#174; operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. 

Vendors 

We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Our largest vendors are Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft, which collectively accounted for a majority of our new product purchases in fiscal 2022. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary gaming product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations. 

Distribution and Information Management 

Our operating strategy involves providing a convenient and broad merchandise selection for our customers. We use our distribution facilities, store locations and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. 

Competition 

The gaming industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains, computer product and consumer electronics stores, other gaming and related specialty stores, toy retail chains, direct sales by software publishers, the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers, game rental companies, and Web 3.0 platforms. Gaming products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value gaming products and other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. 

In the United States, we compete with Walmart Stores, Inc. (&#8220;Walmart&#8221;), Target Corporation (&#8220;Target&#8221;), Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy"), and Amazon.com, Inc. (&#8220;Amazon.com&#8221;), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as FNAC-Darty and Media Markt-Saturn, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Walmart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include JB HiFi stores, Big W, Target, and Amazon.com. Globally, we also compete with certain vendors including Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft among others, for direct-to-consumer offerings. 

Seasonality 

Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions, sales impacts related to temporary store closures, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, the nature and timing of acquisitions, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 38% and 37%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter. 

Trademarks 

We have a number of trademarks and service marks, including &#8220;GameStop &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;Game Informer &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;EB Games &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;EB Electronics Boutique &#174; ,"&#8221; &#8220;Power to the Players &#174; ," and &#8220;PowerUp Rewards &#174; ,&#8221; and "PowerUp Rewards Pro &#174; ," which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and service marks, including &#8220;Micromania &#174; &#8221; and "Zing Pop Culture &#174; ," we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks. 

Human Capital 

At GameStop, we strive to attract, retain and develop talent at all levels of our organization. We have approximately 11,000 full-time salaried and hourly associates and between 14,000 and 27,000 part-time hourly associates worldwide, depending on the time of year. The number of part-time hourly associates fluctuates primarily due to the seasonality of our business. Our human resource philosophy is based on the following tenets: 

&#8226; Development. We are committed to providing our associates with opportunities to develop and grow their careers. We offer learning opportunities through our training programs and high-potential talent development programs as well as educational assistance programs. 

&#8226; Diversity and Inclusion. We advocate working actively to build understanding and collaboration across functions. We believe a more diverse workforce provides many benefits in drawing upon a greater richness of resources, experiences, ideas and talents. 

&#8226; Benefits. We have designed our compensation and benefits programs to meet the unique needs of employees in our various business segments. These programs are intended to attract, reward and retain talent that reflects local communities and customers, while instilling an ownership mentality in our work. 

We are also committed to taking care of our associates in times of need. Through our Gamer Fund employee assistance program, an employee sponsored 501(c)(3) organization, we have provided temporary assistance to more than 3,900 GameStop associates who have experienced unforeseen emergency or hardship, and more than $750,000 in scholarships.

OVERVIEW 

GameStop Corp. (&#8220;GameStop,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its thousands of stores and ecommerce platforms. 

BUSINESS PRIORITIES 

The initial phase of GameStop's transformation largely occurred over the course of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This period was primarily focused on rebuilding the Company's decaying infrastructure and strengthening GameStop's value proposition, including investing in the Company's enterprise systems, technology capabilities, store leaders and store associates, and product catalog and offerings. 

GameStop entered a new phase of its transformation during the back half of 2022. As a result, GameStop is focused on three overarching goals: establishing omnichannel retail excellence, achieving profitability, and leveraging brand equity to support growth. 

We are taking the following steps, with a significant emphasis on cost containment: 

&#8226; Improving margins through operational discipline and increased emphasis on higher margin collectibles and pre-owned product categories; 

&#8226; Ensuring the Company's cost structure is sustainable relative to revenue, including taking steps to optimize our workforce to operate efficiently and nimbly; 

&#8226; Prudently increasing the size of our addressable market by growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality and other categories that represent natural extensions of our business; and 

&#8226; Sustaining a favorable customer experience through seamless in-store and ecommerce platforms and speedy delivery to our customers. 

In connection with our cost reduction efforts, we expect to see favorable impacts to our selling, general, and administrative ("SG&#38;A") expenses in the quarters to come as we pursue profitability. We also maintain and continue to strengthen our strong balance sheet. 

In our pursuit of profitability we seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization globally. While we expect our intense focus on expense reductions to yield decreases in SG&#38;A expenses we continue to explore strategic options, which may include further store closings and exiting unprofitable businesses. As a result of these actions, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and other related expenses. 

By executing on these priorities, we believe we can create a compelling experience for customers and be positioned to invest pragmatically in growth initiatives. In May 2022, we announced the launch of our non-custodial digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive, and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched our NFT marketplace to allow gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Our NFT marketplace enables parties to own their digital assets, which are represented and secured on the blockchain, and allows parties to connect to their own digital asset wallets to enable transactions. In November 2022, we launched the integration of the Immutable X blockchain protocol, which provides access to various Web 3.0 products and NFT gaming assets to our customers. 

We believe the combination of these efforts to stabilize and optimize our core business are critical to achieve sustained profitability to enable long-term value creation for our stockholders.

Net sales decreased $83.5 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Net sales during fiscal 2022 in our Canada and Europe segments increased by 3.6% and 0.1%, respectively, while net sales in our United States and Australia segments decreased by 2.2% and 0.5%, respectively, when compared to fiscal 2021. 

The decrease in consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, a decline in sales from new software releases as a result of fewer significant title launches in fiscal 2022, and a decline in sales of video game accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of new gaming hardware and an increase in sales of toys and collectibles. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit increased $24.3 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 22.4% in fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to a decrease in freight expense as a result of lower ecommerce volume and added cost optimizations, partially offset by the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 

SG&#38;A expenses decreased $28.6 million, or 1.7%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and SG&#38;A as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 remained constant at 28.4%. SG&#38;A expenses decreased primarily due to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, a decrease in marketing expenses, and reduction in labor-related and consulting service costs driven by our focus on cost structure optimization efforts, and the recognition of deferred income related to our partnership with Immutable X Pty Limited ("IMX"). 

Asset Impairments 

Asset impairments related to store-level assets decreased $4.0 million, or 59.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recognized $2.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in asset impairment charges related to store-level assets. See Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 , "Asset Impairments," for additional information related to the impact on our segments. 

Interest (Income) Expense and Other, Net 

Interest (income) expense and other, net decreased by $36.4 million, or 135.3%, shifting from net interest expense in fiscal 2021 to net interest income in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to interest income increasing by $13.1 million in fiscal 2022 as a result of higher returns on invested cash, and interest expense decreasing in fiscal 2022 as a result of lower debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we repaid $73.2 million aggregate principal of our then outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes") and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal of our then outstanding 10% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Notes") including a $17.8 million make-whole premium. 

Income Tax 

We recognized an income tax expense of $11.0 million representing an effective tax rate of (3.6)% in fiscal 2022, compared to an income tax benefit of $14.1 million representing an effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate of (3.6)% in fiscal 2022 is primarily due to not recognizing benefits on certain current period losses, as well as income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate of 3.6% in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to not recognizing benefits on certain current period losses, the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Australia and New Zealand, incremental tax benefits recognized in association with the CARES Act, as well as income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. See Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information.

Sources of Liquidity; Uses of Capital 

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings from the capital markets, which include our revolving credit facilities. As of January 28, 2023, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1,139.0 million, marketable securities of $251.6 million, and an additional $330.7 million of effective available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. 

Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and consist primarily of U.S. government bonds and notes, money market funds, cash deposits with commercial banks, and highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 90 days or less. Our marketable securities are also carried at fair value and include investments in certain highly-rated short-term government bonds and notes that mature in less than one year. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. 

In August 2022, the Company opened investment portfolios consisting of U.S. government treasury notes and bills in an aggregate amount of $250.0 million. As of January 28, 2023, the investment portfolios aggregate balance was $252.6 million, of which $251.6 million are recognized in marketable securities and $1.0 million are recognized in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In fiscal 2021, we sold an aggregate of 34,000,000 shares of our common stock under our at-the market equity offering program (the "ATM Transactions"). We generated $1.67 billion in aggregate net proceeds from sales under the ATM Transactions. The net proceeds generated from sales under the ATM Transactions have been, and are expected to be, used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding our transformation, growth initiatives and product category expansion efforts, capital expenditures and the 

satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees. 

Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we repaid the remaining $73.2 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2023 Senior Notes. Also, in fiscal 2021, the six separate unsecured term loans held by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, for a total of &#8364;40.0 million were extended for five years. As of January 28, 2023, &#8364;36.3 million, or $39.5 million, remains outstanding. 

In November 2021 we entered into a credit agreement for a secured asset-based credit facility comprised of a $500 million revolving line of credit which matures in November 2026 ("2026 Revolver"). As of January 28, 2023, no loan amounts were outstanding under the 2026 Revolver and $119.3 million of standby letters of credit were issued and undrawn under the 2026 Revolver. See Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14 , "Debt," for additional information. 

Separate from the 2026 Revolver, we maintain uncommitted facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of January 28, 2023, we had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $14.5 million outside of the 2026 Revolver, and $57.0 million of collateralized cash which is classified as restricted cash in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, uses for our excess cash in low-risk, short-term investments, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance, our commitments and obligations, our capital requirements, limitations imposed under our credit facilities and overall market conditions. 

Certain vendors have been impacted by volatility in the supply chain financing market. Some of our vendors have requested and may continue to request credit support collateral for our inventory purchase obligations and the levels of such collateral will depend on a variety of factors including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral. 

Cash Flows 

The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

Operating Activities 

In fiscal 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities were an inflow of $108.2 million, compared with an outflow of $434.3 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in merchandise inventory levels and collection of $176.0 million in tax refunds, partially offset by the impact of our net loss. The reduction in merchandise inventory was due to improved inventory management, including a more disciplined purchasing strategy, more advantageous product mix ahead of the fiscal 2022 holiday season, and an improvement in supply chain constraints. Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in merchandise inventory levels when compared to prior year to, among other things, support our product category expansion efforts, and to mitigate the full impact of global supply chain issues. 

Investing activities 

In fiscal 2022, cash flows used in investing activities were an outflow of $222.7 million compared to an outflow of $64.8 million in fiscal 2021. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities and ongoing technological investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of digital assets and proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to technological investments, and investments in our fulfillment operations. 

Financing activities 

In fiscal 2022, cash flows from financing activities were an outflow of $7.9 million compared to an inflow of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to settlement of stock-based awards. Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the sale of shares of our common stock in connection with the ATM transactions for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $136.8 million for withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock, repayment of $73.2 million of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes, and the voluntary early redemption of our outstanding 2023 Senior Notes for an aggregate of $234.2 million (inclusive of a $17.8 million make-whole premium). We also repaid $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our then existing revolving credit facility in 2021. 

Share Repurchases 

On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization allowing us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our Class A Common Stock. The authorization has no expiration date. 

We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020. As of January 28, 2023, we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 28, 2023 other than those disclosed Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16 , "Commitments and Contingencies". 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ from those estimates. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies, as well as the significant accounting policies disclosed in Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 , "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reporting of transactions and events, and the estimates these policies involve our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 

Valuation of Merchandise Inventories 

Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned gaming systems traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, we are required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over-valued items at the lower of cost or market. We consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. 

Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with write-downs of inventory to reflect volumes or pricing of inventory which we believe represents the net realizable value. A 10% change in our obsolescence reserve percentage at January 28, 2023 would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.5 million in fiscal 2022. 

Customer Liabilities 

Our PowerUp Rewards &#174; loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in our stores and on some of our websites that can be redeemed for rewards and discounts. We allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration. The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated amount of points that will never be redeemed, which is a concept known in the retail industry as "breakage." Additionally, we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our website and through selected third parties. At the point of sale, a liability is established for the value of the gift card. We recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer and recognize estimated breakage on gift cards in proportion to historical redemption patterns. 

The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet liability for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted-average retail price per point redeemed. We use historical redemption rates experienced under our loyalty program as a basis for estimating the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. We estimate breakage of loyalty points and unredeemed gift cards based on historical redemption rates. The weighted-average retail price per point redeemed is based on our most recent actual loyalty point redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption values, including the mix of rewards redeemed. Our estimate of the amount and timing of gift card redemptions is based primarily on historical transaction experience. 

We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, retail price per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average retail price per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue balance through current period revenue by an amount estimated to cover the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. A 10% change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate or a 10% change in our weighted-average retail value per point redeemed at January 28, 2023, in each case, would have affected net earnings by approximately $2.8 million in fiscal 2022. A 10% change in our gift card breakage rate at January 28, 2023 would have affected net earnings by approximately $11.9 million in fiscal 2022. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. 

Additionally, a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if it is not more likely than not that the asset will be realized. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Several factors are considered in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including the remaining years available for carry forward, the tax laws for the applicable jurisdictions, the future profitability of the specific business units, and tax planning strategies. Based on our analysis, we have determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowances increased to $408.5 million as of January 28, 2023, primarily due to cumulative losses in certain jurisdictions. See Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. 

We maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $13.2 million as of January 28, 2023. Considerable management judgment is necessary to assess the inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of complex tax laws, regulations and taxing authority rulings, as well as to the expiration of statutes of limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our operations and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. 

Our judgments and estimates concerning uncertain tax positions may change as a result of evaluation of new information, such as the outcome of tax audits or changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations. Our judgments and estimates concerning realizability of deferred tax assets could change if any of the evaluation factors change. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in any period, impacting our net earnings.
