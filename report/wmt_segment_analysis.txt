Instruction: 
Identify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis 
and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. Address revenue and net profit with specific data, 
and calculate the changes. Detail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. 
Describe product innovations and their effects on income growth. Quantify market share and its changes, or state market position 
and its changes. Analyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. Include the cost side, 
detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. Support each statement with evidence, 
keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. For each segment, consolidate the most 
significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and 
reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.
